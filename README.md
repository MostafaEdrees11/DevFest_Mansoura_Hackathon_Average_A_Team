customized for customers.
Today, we have a story about a land. That land embraced us for thousands of years and gave 
us life, and food. Source to survive… Being able to work, Create, Build, and evolve around. 
as when we are here the world one billion, this number we think of several stars in the sky but 
unfortunately, this number refers to how many animals vanished due to unexpected fires in Egypt, 
California last year. 32 species of them are in danger of extinction.
fires are one of the worst disasters to hit the country. It destroys everything not only buildings but also 
humans undermines the national economy by billions of dollars and destroys the bio-systems.
All these effects affect sustainable development and prevent us from achieving this goal as it 
destroys the 3 main pillars of sustainable development which are.
1- Environmental pillar ( climate  )
2- Economical pillar ( Business and cooperates )
3- social pillar. (people and lives)

## Ai Model & AR Escape Map
### Ai Model
we used the AI model YOLOV5 to capture images to inform how big the fire becomes, 
and a built-in image processing feature will immediately check the image and verify it. 
Then, images would be uploaded to our database to be processed and classified to get more information about 
the fire in this area send proper notification to near users and authorities and 
display this info on the map in our app.

- Users can release an evocation to get help from other users or authorities, 
and this evocation would contain the user's location and a message to explain the situation. 
This evocation would appear on the map and whoever can help can chat with users in need to give a hand, 
also they can send a message to hospitals or firefighters to find them.
